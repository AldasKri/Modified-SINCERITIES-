# Modified-SINCERITIES-
SINCERITIES stands for SINgle CEll Regularized Inference using TIme-stamped Expression profileS. This algorithm is used to predict gene regulatory networks. 

I implemented five new distribution-distance metrics (Kullback–Leibler, Jensen–Shannon Divergence, Hellinger Distance, Wasserstein Distance, and Total Variation Distance) and benchmarked them across eight time-series single-cell simulation datasets with uneven time points (6–10) and sigma values (1–4). The new metrics demonstrated comparable performance, expanding users’ options for GRN inference. This allows users greater flexibility in their data analysis without compromising accuracy or performance.
