# Modified-SINCERITIES-
SINCERITIES stands for SINgle CEll Regularized Inference using TIme-stamped Expression profileS. This algorithm is used to predict gene regulatory networks. I have made modifications to the code in an effort to give the user more options without compromising the performance of the code.

Credits for the original code goes to Papili Gao N, Ud-Dean SMM, Gandrillon O, Gunawan
